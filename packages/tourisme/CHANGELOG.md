# @geoalgeria/tourisme

## 2.0.3

### Patch Changes

- e056b8d: Reform-stale wilaya corrections (yasserstudio/geoalgeria.com#209): records whose source still files them under the wilaya their commune belonged to before the 2026 reform (law 26-06, JO 25; presidential decree 26-206, JO 40) now carry the current wilaya, with the commune the correction was derived from. Each is a reviewed decision in `quality/overrides/tourisme.json`, so a regeneration reapplies it and stops if the source's own value has moved. No id changes.

## 2.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 4deabd3: Replace em dashes in source names and citations with plain separators.

  - Every source `name` reads `Operator: descriptor`, where it used to carry a
    U+2014 em dash, in `data/metadata.json` and in the `dataset-metadata.json`
    descriptor built from it.
  - The schema.org/DCAT `citation` entries join a source name and its licence with
    a comma: `OpenStreetMap: schools & kindergartens in Algeria, ODbL 1.0 (© OpenStreetMap contributors)`.
  - Coverage notes, package `description`s, the `types/index.d.ts` documentation and
    the `index.js` headers carry a colon, comma or semicolon in place of the dash.

  No count, coordinate, licence or date changes. Consumers that match a source name
  or a citation string literally need to update the separator; anything keyed on
  `sources[].key` is unaffected. `pnpm validate` now fails on an em dash in
  published metadata, so it cannot come back through a generator.

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 76dfd0d: Declare the exact per-package licence terms in the manifest and the LICENSE file.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- e84384a: Data v2 — one canonical record contract across every sector package (breaking schema overhaul).

  Every sector package now shares a single record shape defined by the new `@geoalgeria/schema` dependency, replacing the hand-written, drifted `types/index.d.ts` per package. Read [`packages/schema/MIGRATING.md`](https://github.com/yasserstudio/geoalgeria/blob/main/packages/schema/MIGRATING.md) before adopting `2.0.0`.

  - **Breaking record shape**: `wilaya_code` is a zero-padded **string** (`"16"`, not `16`); commune linkage is `commune_code` (string ONS code) + `commune`; coordinates are `lat`/`lng`; external ids collapse into `refs: { osm, wikidata, … }`; `id` is an opaque string unique within its file (no more global `{sector}:{WW}-{seq}` form). Every record ships in **JSON, CSV and GeoJSON**.
  - **Breaking `geo_precision`**: strictly `exact | approximate | null`, **null if and only if** the record has no coordinate; the old method vocabulary moved to a new `geo_method` field under the same null-iff rule. `exact` now requires ≥3 decimals and a point unique within its file — 409 records that could not carry that claim were downgraded to `approximate`.
  - **Honest metadata**: real per-source `retrieved` dates; licence URLs only where the source is genuinely open, `conditionsOfAccess` prose otherwise. A root `index.json` catalog and a `schema.org/Dataset` descriptor ship alongside the data.
  - **Data fixes**: the capital-coordinate 9-cycle swap repaired; 30+11 mislinked records relinked; emploi communes recovered; 972 previously-dropped tourisme values restored.

  Not part of this release: the core `geoalgeria` dataset and `@geoalgeria/telecom` predate this contract and stay on their current v1 versions until migrated.
