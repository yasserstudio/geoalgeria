## 2.2.3

### Patch Changes

- 924b092: Rebuild 14 sector packages on the 189 corrected commune centres, and join the commune by containment in its OpenStreetMap outline instead of by distance: 46 coordinates moved, 8,036 commune links re-derived, 697 wilaya moves, and not one published id changed.

  `geoalgeria` corrects 189 commune centres in this same release. Every package here derives from those values, so none of it was right until it was rebuilt against them. Three separate things were wrong.

  **46 coordinates were a repudiated commune centre.** These records have no point of their own: they borrow their commune's centre and say so in `geo_method`. The copy does not follow the original. Moved: `@geoalgeria/sante` 19, `@geoalgeria/formation-professionnelle` 15, `@geoalgeria/industrie-pharmaceutique` 8, `@geoalgeria/enseignement-superieur` 2 and `@geoalgeria/agriculture` 2. Precision is unchanged and still honest: these are commune-level placements, and they now name the commune's current centre.

  **The join itself was wrong, not just its inputs, and it took two passes to fix.** `commune`, `commune_code` and `wilaya_code` were stamped by **unrestricted nearest commune centroid**, which makes every commune centre an attractor for everything around it, so moving 189 centres pushed 58 published records into a wilaya whose polygon does not contain them at all: mosque `31-0390`, at `[-0.414678, 35.547628]`, is inside OpenStreetMap's commune 3111 Oued Tlelat in wilaya 31 and read Zahana in wilaya 29.

  The first replacement pinned the candidate communes to the wilaya whose **shipped polygon** contains the point. That is wrong wherever a shipped polygon is, and the shipped wilaya 55 polygon was about 50 km short of the decree boundary (`yasserstudio/geoalgeria.com#171`, which rebuilds it in this same release): it moved 79 records out of El-Hadjira (5507) and El Alia (5513) into N'goussa (3003) in wilaya 30. Mosque `55-0051` at `[5.513943, 32.615544]` is inside OpenStreetMap's El-Hadjira relation 6542937 and read N'goussa, 56.1 km from the centre it was given; pharmacy `55-00012`, whose address says الحجيرة, and library `55-library-02`, whose name ends "El Alia", went the same way.

  The rule is now `scripts/lib/commune-resolver.mjs`, the commune outline decides first and globally, and the wilaya comes from the commune registry rather than from a polygon this repository already knows is wrong:

  1. a coordinate with fewer than three decimals is too coarse to re-join, so the published commune stands (`kept_low_precision`, 42 records). The patrimoine portal's whole-degree placeholders are why `19-bcp-08` at `[6, 36]` stays in wilaya 19 instead of being re-attributed to wilaya 43.
  2. a commune OpenStreetMap ships no relation for cannot be contradicted by geometry, so the published commune stands (`kept_no_outline`, 186 records): Souk Oufella (630), Bir Touta (1634), Collo (2110) and Dhayet Bendhahoua (4703), whose territory is still inside the commune they were split out of, so containment says the neighbour and containment is wrong. School `16-01308` is 1.85 km from Bir Touta's centre and 6.14 km from Douira's.
  3. any commune whose OpenStreetMap `admin_level=8` outline contains the point wins outright (`commune_outline`, 40,623 records), with an overlap resolved in favour of the commune the record already named.
  4. only where no outline holds the point does distance decide, among the communes of the wilaya whose shipped polygon does, plus any outline-less commune within 10 km (`wilaya_nearest`, 34 records).
  5. a point no wilaya polygon holds keeps its published commune (`kept_outside_wilaya_polygons`, 1 record). The national fallback that used to run there while reporting `published_wilaya_nearest` is deleted.

  A record moves commune only where containment supports the move or the point has demonstrably left its old commune's outline.

  **8,036 `commune` links moved and 697 `wilaya_code` with them**, and this time every package that relabels is named. Per package, links and wilaya moves: mosquees 4,931 and 624, ecoles 1,931 and 28, pharmacies 500 and 11, cliniques 295 and 1, ferroviaire 189 and 18, culture 123 and 10, ooredoo 51 and 3, djezzy 12 and 0, gares-routieres 4 and 0. `@geoalgeria/formation-professionnelle` relabels no commune but moves 2 wilayas, and it is the one package the rebuilt wilaya 55 and 47 polygons change: CFPA El Mansoura (`01818`, commune المنصورة) reads 47 instead of 58 and CFPA El Hadjira (`01905`, commune الحجيرة) reads 55 instead of 30. Neither carries a `commune_code`, so the clause that decides them is the wilaya-polygon fallback, which is exactly the clause #171 corrects. Across those nine packages, records inside the OpenStreetMap outline of the commune they name go from **80.2% to 99.9%** (40,654 of the 40,695 rows whose commune has an outline); per package: djezzy and gares-routieres 100%, cliniques, ecoles and mosquees 99.9%, culture, ooredoo and pharmacies 99.8%, ferroviaire 99.7%. The 41 still outside are the rows clauses 1, 2 and 5 keep plus a handful inside the reduced outline's own error at a commune seam, and each is listed in `research/_wilaya-containment/record-exceptions.json`. `test/record-in-declared-wilaya.test.mjs` now holds every published record to its commune outline first and to the wilaya polygon only where there is no outline to ask; it finds 360 violations, all 360 pre-existing and **0 created by this release**. It was 396 before #171 rebuilt the wilaya 55 and 47 polygons from their member communes: 36 rows in packages this release does not touch stop being violations, 28 of them declaring wilaya 55 and 8 declaring wilaya 47, and not one row was added. Several records agree with their own source address where the nearest centre never did: Djezzy's "Barika-centre, Barika, Batna" and SOGRAL's "Commune El Hadjeb Biskra".

  Two warning counts fall, both measured per tree rather than quoted. `scripts/validate-packages.mjs` warns when a point is outside the display-grade polygon of the wilaya it declares, which `quality/accuracy-review` counts as `outside_declared_wilaya`: **1,159 on `main`, 572 before #171, 447 here**. Its neighbour `inside_adjacent_wilaya` reads **960, 373, 248**. 127 of the 572 were wilaya 55 and 47 rows this repository drew in the wrong wilaya, and #171 ends every one of them without creating a new warning. Of the 447 left, 118 are inside the OpenStreetMap outline of the commune they name, so it is the shipped polygon that is wrong about them and not the record, and every one of those is a display-grade seam on a border #171 does not redraw.

  **No published id was retired, renumbered or minted.** Ids are public join keys, so a coordinate correction is not the release that churns them, and it was verified per package before and after with a fresh recomputed diff: 196, 1,913, 1,083, 128, 11,858, 177, 692, 1,932, 74, 171, 20,759, 572, 3,807 and 695, each the same set in the same order. Three packages would have churned and did not. `@geoalgeria/sante` replays, but its MSP capture re-pairs FR/AR posts once corrected commune names land and retires published ids, so its coordinates moved through `scripts/sync-commune-centroid-dependents.mjs` instead, as in the previous batch. `@geoalgeria/ooredoo` and `@geoalgeria/ferroviaire` had no carry-over at all: their ids are `{wilaya}-{seq}` assigned from the commune join, so the stores and stations that changed wilaya re-sequenced 43 and 18 published ids and retired `20-004`, `31-034` and eighteen station ids on the first replay. Both generators now pin each record back to the id it shipped under, keyed on the operator's own store id and on the station's Wikidata or OSM id; it is the pattern nine other packages here already used. A record that re-joins therefore keeps its id, which is why a mosque id can read `26-0114` while its `wilaya_code` reads `10`.

  **Record counts, names, types, contacts and hours are untouched in every package**, checked field by field against `main`: only `lat`/`lng`, `commune`, `commune_code` and `wilaya_code` changed, plus the `metadata.json` fields derived from them. Ten of the fourteen were rebuilt by re-running their own generator against its committed capture, offline (`sante` before `cliniques`, which reads sante's data to exclude the hospital tier); the four that cannot replay offline were patched by `scripts/sync-commune-centroid-dependents.mjs`, which reproduces the same reads of the flagship and nothing else.

  `@geoalgeria/protection-civile` and `@geoalgeria/buses` are not in this release: neither has a stale borrowed centre and neither moved a commune link.

  This release depends on the wilaya-membership correction in the same batch (`yasserstudio/geoalgeria.com#171`), which rebuilds the wilaya 30/55 and 47/58 polygons from their own member communes. Every generator here was replayed on top of it, so the fallback clause that reads those polygons answers from the corrected geometry.

## 2.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 0df7cb4: Rebuild 13 sector packages on the corrected commune centres: 45 coordinates moved, 1,178 commune links re-derived.

  `geoalgeria` corrects 56 commune centres in this same release, by 0.75 km to 217 km. Every package here derives from those values, so none of it was right until they were rebuilt against them. Two separate things were stale.

  **45 coordinates were a repudiated commune centre.** These records have no point of their own: they borrow their commune's centre and say so in `geo_method`. The copy does not follow the original. `@geoalgeria/sante`'s _EPH El Harrach (Hassan Badi)_ shipped at the old El Harrach value, 51.5 km from the hospital and inside wilaya 35; the 23 Algiers institutions of `@geoalgeria/agriculture` sat on the Alger Centre point that was in the sea. Moved: sante 7, agriculture 23, formation-professionnelle 10 (including the CFPAs of Melbou, Mazagran, Marsa Ben M'Hidi and Chelghoum Laid), enseignement-superieur 3 (ENP, ENSA and EPAU, all at El Harrach) and industrie-pharmaceutique 2 (SAIDAL El Harrach, BIO OSTEO). Precision is unchanged and still honest: these are commune-level placements, they now name the commune's current centre.

  **1,178 `commune_code` links moved, and 270 `wilaya_code` with them.** `commune` and `commune_code` are stamped by nearest commune centroid, so a centre that moves 25 km stops being the nearest for everything around where it was and starts being it around where it is. Re-derived: mosquees 720, ecoles 266, pharmacies 105, cliniques 39, culture 29, ooredoo 13, djezzy 3 and protection-civile 3. Wilaya moved for 254 mosques, 10 cultural places and 6 pharmacies.

  **Record counts, names, types, contacts and ids are untouched in every package.** Only `lat`/`lng`, `commune`, `commune_code` and `wilaya_code` changed, plus the `metadata.json` fields derived from them (sante's bbox reaches 37.065 now that Chetaibi is on the coast). Ten of the thirteen were rebuilt by re-running their own generator against its committed capture, offline; the other three cannot replay offline and were patched by `scripts/sync-commune-centroid-dependents.mjs`, which reproduces the same reads of the flagship and nothing else.

  **This release is also the first rebuild since the JORA name corrections of 2.1.0**, which no dependent had picked up either. That accounts for a further 3,031 `commune` labels now matching the flagship spelling (`Ain Madhi` to `Aïn Madhi`, `Hassi R'mel` to `Hassi R'Mel`), 258 `commune_code` and 47 `wilaya_code` from the same earlier pass, and one vocational centre in Ouamri that is placed for the first time because its commune name now resolves.

  **A guard keeps the class out.** `pnpm validate` now checks every record that declares a commune-level placement against the flagship: 1,151 of them, and a coordinate that is not the current centre of the commune it names fails the build. It is a table of the bound `geo_method` values, not a guess, because three commune-flavoured methods in this repository are deliberately not a flagship centre (the Ooredoo 5G per-commune points, and the wilaya-mean placements of industrie-pharmaceutique and enseignement-superieur).

  Closes yasserstudio/geoalgeria.com#169.

- 4deabd3: Replace em dashes in source names and citations with plain separators.

  - Every source `name` reads `Operator: descriptor`, where it used to carry a
    U+2014 em dash, in `data/metadata.json` and in the `dataset-metadata.json`
    descriptor built from it.
  - The schema.org/DCAT `citation` entries join a source name and its licence with
    a comma: `OpenStreetMap: schools & kindergartens in Algeria, ODbL 1.0 (© OpenStreetMap contributors)`.
  - Coverage notes, package `description`s, the `types/index.d.ts` documentation and
    the `index.js` headers carry a colon, comma or semicolon in place of the dash.

  No count, coordinate, licence or date changes. Consumers that match a source name
  or a citation string literally need to update the separator; anything keyed on
  `sources[].key` is unaffected. `pnpm validate` now fails on an em dash in
  published metadata, so it cannot come back through a generator.

## 2.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 76dfd0d: Declare the exact per-package licence terms in the manifest and the LICENSE file.

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 586c0cc: Refresh the public OSM, ANEM, and mobile-operator sources through 2026-08-31,
  including updated records, opening hours, labels, and canonical Mobilis wilaya
  assignments.

### Patch Changes

- ef41100: Keep retired public record IDs permanently reserved across data refreshes and
  exclude the internal retirement ledger from catalog distributions.

## 2.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 64b10a1: Replace duplicated and missing `code_commune` values with the 1,541 unique codes from the official ONS 2021 Code Géographique National. Cascade the corrected foreign keys through every linked dataset, preserve Algérie Poste's differing provider-native values, enforce the SQL and repository-wide FK contracts, retain the 2021 mother-wilaya prefix for communes promoted in later reforms, and document the code contract.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- ec011f3: Fresh OpenStreetMap re-survey (2026-08-08 pull, `timestamp_osm_base` 2026-08-08T14:50:21Z): 3,790 to **3,797** pharmacies, **2,461** named, still **67** wilayas. 9 added and 2 dropped upstream (`44-00029` Barça Toufiq in Aïn Defla and `47-00001` in Ghardaïa). Precision 3,509 exact / 288 approximate. Enrichment moves a little: 146 with phone, 257 with opening hours (was 255), 1,163 with address (was 1,159), 526 with a `dispensing` flag (was 524). The 1,769-way bulk-import artifact near Attatba is still detected and excluded.

  **Ids of surviving records are stable.** All 3,788 records that survive the re-survey keep the id they shipped under, so existing joins on `id` keep working across re-surveys. The fetcher now runs `carryOverIds` keyed on the OSM id before writing, matching the other sector packages. Without it the positional `{wilaya_code}-{seq}` sequence re-homed 1,120 records, because a single pharmacy inserted upstream shifts every later record in its wilaya.

  Four records are re-linked against the current core set rather than against OSM: two points near Menaa move from Aïn Oussera (65) to Bou Saâda (68), and two near Bou Saâda re-link from Bou Saâda to Ouled Sidi Brahim. Since ids carry over, the id prefix on those records no longer matches their `wilaya_code`, which is expected under the v2 contract where `id` is opaque. Eleven records pick up upstream name edits, mostly generic "Pharmacie" placeholders being cleared or a bilingual name being split into `name_fr` / `name_ar`.

  `commune_code` nulls go 18 to **21**. The two re-linked Menaa records drop `"1709"` for null, and the new `16-00749` ships null. Both communes exist in the core set but carry no `code_commune` there (Menaa in wilaya 68, Bologhine Ibnou Ziri in wilaya 16), so this is an upstream gap in `packages/dataset`, not a regression in the join. `commune` names on those records are populated as usual.

  `metadata.json` keeps `evidence_type: "crowdsourced"` on the OpenStreetMap source. `buildMetadata` passes `sources[]` through verbatim, so the fetcher now pins the value instead of leaving it off and silently dropping the provenance claim on every rebuild.

  No API or shape changes: record contract, file layout and loaders are exactly as before.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- e84384a: Data v2 — one canonical record contract across every sector package (breaking schema overhaul).

  Every sector package now shares a single record shape defined by the new `@geoalgeria/schema` dependency, replacing the hand-written, drifted `types/index.d.ts` per package. Read [`packages/schema/MIGRATING.md`](https://github.com/yasserstudio/geoalgeria/blob/main/packages/schema/MIGRATING.md) before adopting `2.0.0`.

  - **Breaking record shape**: `wilaya_code` is a zero-padded **string** (`"16"`, not `16`); commune linkage is `commune_code` (string ONS code) + `commune`; coordinates are `lat`/`lng`; external ids collapse into `refs: { osm, wikidata, … }`; `id` is an opaque string unique within its file (no more global `{sector}:{WW}-{seq}` form). Every record ships in **JSON, CSV and GeoJSON**.
  - **Breaking `geo_precision`**: strictly `exact | approximate | null`, **null if and only if** the record has no coordinate; the old method vocabulary moved to a new `geo_method` field under the same null-iff rule. `exact` now requires ≥3 decimals and a point unique within its file — 409 records that could not carry that claim were downgraded to `approximate`.
  - **Honest metadata**: real per-source `retrieved` dates; licence URLs only where the source is genuinely open, `conditionsOfAccess` prose otherwise. A root `index.json` catalog and a `schema.org/Dataset` descriptor ship alongside the data.
  - **Data fixes**: the capital-coordinate 9-cycle swap repaired; 30+11 mislinked records relinked; emploi communes recovered; 972 previously-dropped tourisme values restored.

  Not part of this release: the core `geoalgeria` dataset and `@geoalgeria/telecom` predate this contract and stay on their current v1 versions until migrated.

## 1.0.0

Algeria's pharmacies — 3,790 officines from OpenStreetMap, geocoded, bilingual where named, wilaya/commune-linked.

### Added

- 3,790 pharmacies (`amenity=pharmacy`) across 67 wilayas from **OpenStreetMap**
  (ODbL), each geocoded, de-duplicated (same-name-within-40 m and coincident
  points), with FR/AR names routed by script where present.
- Contact tags where OSM has them: 2,459 named, 146 with phone, 255 with opening
  hours, 1,159 with address, 524 with a `dispensing` flag.
- Wilaya/commune linkage by nearest-centroid join against the geoalgeria base
  dataset (wilaya effectively exact, commune best-effort), stable `{wilaya}-{seq}`
  ids ordered by OSM id.
- Honest partial-coverage framing (~3.8k mapped vs an estimated ~11k officines
  nationally; no open official registry).
- JSON, CSV, GeoJSON, TypeScript types, and a `npm run fetch` rebuild script.
